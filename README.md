This repository contains the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) report for the CubeSat project developed as part of my Introduction to Space Engineering course. Named Ege-SAT, the CubeSat is designed to monitor forest areas near the Aegean region of Turkey for a period of six years. The main payload, a high-resolution camera, is intended to capture images that can be analyzed for forest coverage changes over time, contributing to environmental monitoring efforts.

The report details all aspects of the CubeSatâ€™s design, including mission objectives, payload specifications, subsystems, and operational plans. It covers the technical breakdown of critical components like the on-board computer, power management, communication systems, and attitude control. The document also includes analyses of system budgets, link budget calculations, and a proposed project timeline. This comprehensive PDR serves as the foundation for future development stages and potential implementation of Ege-SAT.
